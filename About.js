        Rotating locomotion in living systems includes both the rolling of
        entire organisms, and the use of structures that propel by rotating
        relative to a fixed body, such as a wheel or propeller. Though the
        former mode is used by varied forms of life, including pangolins and
        tumbleweeds, the latter is only known to occur in bacteria using
        microscopic, corkscrew-like flagella. While other human technologies,
        like wings and lenses, have common natural analogues, multicellular
        organisms have apparently never evolved rotating propulsive structures.
        Such structures may be infeasible to grow and maintain with biological
        processes. Compared with walking or running on limbs, in natural
        environments, wheeled propulsion is rarely as energy-efficient,
        versatile, or capable of navigating obstacles. This is likely why wheels
        were regionally abandoned at least once in history. Rolling and wheeled
